## Environment Challenges

The local environment has version compatibility issues:

## Immediate Solutions for APK Generation

### Option 1: Online APK Builder (Recommended)

1. **Appcircle** (https://appcircle.io/)

   - Upload your project as ZIP
   - Free builds available
   - No local setup required

2. **Buildkite** (https://buildkite.com/)
   - Cloud-based React Native builds
   - Professional CI/CD solution

### Option 2: Update Node.js Version

```powershell
# Install latest Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
# Then run:
node --version  # Should be v20.19.4+
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
npx react-native build-android --mode=release
```

### Option 3: Expo Development Build

```powershell
# Create development build (requires Expo account)
npx eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Option 4: GitHub Actions (Automated)

The project includes `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` for automated APK generation on GitHub.

### Option 5: Expo Web Version (Immediate Testing)

Your app can run in a web browser for immediate testing:
